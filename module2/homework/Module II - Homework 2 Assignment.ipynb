    "\n",
    "1. The [Sean Lahman's Baseball Database](http://seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics) which contains the \"complete batting and pitching statistics from 1871 to 2013, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, post-season data, and more. For more details on the latest release, please [read the documentation](http://seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2012.txt).\"\n",

    "a. Load in CSV files from the web. \n",
    "\n",
    "b. Create functions in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "C. Create plots and summary statistics for exploratory data analysis such as histograms, boxplots and scatter plots. \n",
